# VendoorX — Nigeria's AI-Powered WhatsApp Commerce Platform

## Recently Completed Features (Latest Session)

### Animations
- The custom GSAP/Lottie animation layer was removed at the user's request. The codebase now relies only on plain CSS transitions/Tailwind animations that were already in place.

### Per-Order Seller-Set Delivery Window
- New nullable column `orders.delivery_duration_days` (1–30, NULL = use default 5). Migration: `supabase/add_delivery_duration.sql` — paste once into the Supabase SQL editor.
- Seller-only endpoint `PATCH /api/backend/orders/:id/delivery-duration` (validator: `setDeliveryDurationSchema`). Allowed only while order is `paid`. Sends a `delivery_estimate_set` notification to the buyer on save.
- `backend/src/jobs/autoCancelOrders.ts` now respects per-order durations (default 5 days when NULL); pre-filters orders ≥1 day old then evaluates the per-order window in JS. Falls back gracefully if the column hasn't been added yet (logs a warning, treats every order as default).
- Seller UI: blue "Delivery window" picker (1/2/3/5/7/10/14/21/30 days) above the "Mark as Shipped" button on each paid order in `app/seller-orders/page.tsx`. Shows current value when set; Save button disabled until value changes.
- API client: `ordersApi.setDeliveryDuration(id, days)` in `lib/api.ts`.

### Two-Way Offer Conversations + Escrow Refund Fix + Order Detail Page
- **Offers — full negotiation thread:** new `offer_messages` table (`scripts/030_offer_messages.sql`) lets buyer & seller exchange replies and counter-prices on a single offer. New routes:
  - `GET/PATCH /api/offers/[id]` — fetch single offer with both parties; accept/decline/withdraw/counter
  - `GET/POST /api/offers/[id]/messages` — list & post messages, sets offer to `countered` when a counter price is sent
  - Conversation UI at `app/offers/[id]/page.tsx` with light 5s polling
  - Inbox at `app/dashboard/offers/page.tsx` with Received/Sent tabs
  - `POST /api/offers` now returns the new offer id; `make-offer-dialog.tsx` shows an "Open Chat" button that deep-links into the conversation
- **Escrow refund bug fix:** `reversePendingCredit` in `backend/src/services/walletService.ts` now takes `(sellerId, buyerId, orderId, amount)` and credits the buyer's wallet `available` balance in addition to reversing the seller's pending credit. Removed the duplicate Paystack `/refund` call (funds stayed on the platform's Paystack balance, so the in-wallet credit is the actual refund). Auto-cancel job (`backend/src/jobs/autoCancelOrders.ts`) now also refunds the buyer when an order is auto-cancelled after 5 days unshipped.
- **Order detail page:** created `app/dashboard/orders/[id]/page.tsx` (was missing — payment callback redirected to a 404). Shows status tracker, product summary, contextual CTAs (pay if pending), and embeds `OrderChat` for buyer↔seller messaging at any non-cancelled status.
- **Buy Now spinner:** `components/features/product-buy-button.tsx` shows a loading spinner during the auth check before opening the checkout modal.
- **Removed Instagram/Facebook CTAs** from `components/product/product-interactions.tsx`, `app/marketplace/[id]/page.tsx`, and `app/sellers/[id]/page.tsx`.
- **Mobile responsiveness pass** on `app/auth/login/page.tsx` and `app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx`: tighter padding on small screens, smaller heading sizes, no-wrap "Sign in/up" link to prevent header overflow.

**Pending DB action:** run `scripts/030_offer_messages.sql` in Supabase SQL editor.



### 10-Platform-Improvement Build Pass

**#1 — Order status push notifications:**
- Created `backend/src/services/notificationService.ts` — inserts into `notifications` table via Supabase admin + fire-and-forget push to `/api/push/send`
- Updated `backend/src/services/orderService.ts` — `updateOrderStatus()` now sends targeted notifications:
  - `paid` → seller gets "New Order — Action Required"
  - `shipped` → buyer gets "Your Order is on the Way!"
  - `delivered` → buyer gets "Order Marked as Delivered"
  - `completed` → both parties notified; seller's wallet released
  - `cancelled` → both parties notified

**#2 — Fix admin chat page profiles showing "Unknown":**
- Updated `app/api/admin/chats/route.ts` to fetch profiles from `profiles` table using service-role client and include them in the API response as `profiles: Record<string, string>`
- Updated `app/admin/chats/page.tsx` to remove the anon-key Supabase client entirely; uses profile names directly from API response

**#3 — Supabase Realtime on order_chats:**
- Created `scripts/013_realtime_order_chats.sql` — run in Supabase SQL Editor to enable Realtime for `order_chats` and `vendor_locations` tables

**#4 — Location data expiry/cleanup:**
- Created `backend/src/jobs/locationCleanup.ts` — deletes `vendor_locations` rows older than 30 minutes; runs every 30 min
- Registered in `backend/src/server.ts`

**#5 — New user onboarding flow:**
- Created `components/dashboard/onboarding-banner.tsx` — dismissible progress banner with 3 steps (complete profile, add listing, get verified); uses localStorage to remember dismissal
- Integrated into `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — shown to new users who haven't completed all steps

**#6 — Seller analytics dashboard:**
- Created `app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` — full analytics with:
  - 7 stat cards (revenue, orders, listings, completion rate, views, clicks, CTR)
  - Revenue over time area chart (Recharts)
  - Orders by status bar chart
  - Top listings table by views
- Added "Analytics" link to vendor sidebar (`components/vendor/vendor-sidebar.tsx`)

**#7 — Account deletion + data export:**
- Created `app/api/account/delete/route.ts` — anonymises profile, cancels pending orders, deactivates listings, removes push subscriptions, deletes auth user
- Created `app/api/account/export/route.ts` — downloads user's profile, listings, orders, reviews, notifications as JSON (NDPR-compliant)
- Added "Danger Zone" section to Security tab in `app/profile/page.tsx` — Export Data button + typed DELETE confirmation for account deletion

**#8 — Auto-cancel unshipped orders:**
- Created `backend/src/jobs/autoCancelOrders.ts` — cancels `paid` orders older than 5 days with no ship update; notifies both buyer (refund notice) and seller; runs every 6 hours
- Registered in `backend/src/server.ts`

**#9 — Stock quantity enforcement:**
- Updated `backend/src/services/orderService.ts` — after order is inserted, stock is decremented atomically: `stock_quantity = max(0, stock_quantity - quantity)`
- Stock check already existed; decrement was the missing piece

**#10 — Payout history page:**
- Created `app/dashboard/wallet/payouts/page.tsx` — lists all withdrawal requests with status badges (pending/paid/failed/rejected), bank name, masked account number, total paid/pending summary
- Added "Payout History" link to wallet page header

### Previous Session — T001–T013 Build Pass — All Features Verified & Gaps Fixed

**T001 — Next.js 16 proxy convention:** Confirmed `proxy.ts` is correctly set up (exports `proxy` function). Removed a conflicting `middleware.ts` that was causing a startup error. Logs confirm `proxy.ts: 504ms` running cleanly.

**T002 — Image CSS position:** All `<Image fill>` parents have `position: relative` set. No changes needed.

**T003 — University email validation + badge:**
- Added `is_student_verified: boolean` to `Profile` type (`lib/types.ts`)
- Added blue "Student" badge (GraduationCap icon) to seller store pages (`app/store/[slug]/page.tsx`) — appears alongside the verified seller badge
- Added GraduationCap badge to product card seller row (`components/marketplace/product-card.tsx`)
- Sign-up already auto-detects university email domain and stores `is_student_verified` in user metadata

**T004 — Search autocomplete:** `SearchAutocomplete` component was fully implemented and integrated in the marketplace page. Verified working.

**T005 — Price drop indicator:** Strikethrough "Was ₦X" and `{N}% off` badge already implemented on both product card and product detail page. Verified working.

- Also: `app/api/admin/site-settings/route.ts` — Added `revalidateTag('site-settings')` call on every successful PUT to instantly bust the 60s Next.js cache
- `lib/site-settings.ts` — Now uses `unstable_cache` with `{ tags: ['site-settings'] }` for proper ISR + tag-based revalidation

**T013 — Restart & Verify:** Both workflows restarted. App serving 200s. Backend API on port 3001. `proxy.ts` running correctly.

**Additional (backend audit):**
- Created `scripts/012_trust_score_functions.sql` — SQL for Supabase `increment_vendor_orders` and `increment_vendor_disputes` RPC functions needed by the trust score system. Run in Supabase SQL Editor.

## Architecture

This project has two services running side-by-side:

### Frontend — Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Port**: 5000
- **Workflow**: `Start application` → `npm run dev`
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components
- **Auth**: Supabase SSR (`@supabase/ssr`) with middleware session refresh
- **State**: Zustand (auth, listing, profile) + TanStack Query (API data fetching)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion on product cards and order expansion
- **Key directories**:
  - `app/` — App Router pages and layouts
    - `app/dashboard/orders/` — Order history with status tracking
    - `app/payment/callback/` — Paystack payment result page
  - `components/` — Shared UI components (shadcn/ui)
    - `components/features/` — Integration components (checkout, WhatsApp CTA, order tracker, buy button)
    - `components/marketplace/` — Product card (enhanced with Framer Motion)
    - `components/providers.tsx` — TanStack Query provider wrapper
  - `lib/api.ts` — Backend REST API client (all endpoints)
  - `lib/query-client.ts` — TanStack Query client singleton
  - `hooks/use-orders.ts` — Order CRUD hooks (useMyOrders, useCreateOrder, useInitializePayment, etc.)
  - `store/` — Zustand state management
- **Backend URL**: Set via `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` env var → backend on port 3001 (only used for non-verification operations; verification now uses Next.js API routes)
- **Verification API routes**: `app/api/verification/status/route.ts` (GET) and `app/api/verification/submit/route.ts` (POST) use Supabase service role directly — avoids unreachable backend port

### Backend — Express.js API v2 (VendorX) — TypeScript
- **Port**: 3001
- **Workflow**: `Backend API` → `cd backend && npx tsx src/server.ts`
- **Language**: TypeScript (runs via tsx — no build step needed)
- **Architecture**: Controller → Service → Repository → Supabase
- **Key directories**:
  - `backend/src/controllers/` — Thin HTTP handlers
  - `backend/src/services/` — Business logic (auth, product, order, payment, WhatsApp)
  - `backend/src/repositories/` — DB abstraction layer (Supabase queries)
  - `backend/src/queues/` — BullMQ async jobs (messages, payments, notifications)
  - `backend/src/bots/` — WhatsApp bot engine (intent detection, response builder)
  - `backend/src/config/` — Supabase, Redis, Paystack, Swagger
  - `backend/src/middleware/` — Auth JWT, error handler, rate limiter, request logger
  - `backend/src/validators/` — Zod schemas
  - `backend/src/types/` — Shared TypeScript types
  - `backend/src/utils/` — Logger (Winston), helpers, Redis cache wrapper
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:3001/api/docs (Swagger UI)

## Required Environment Variables (Secrets)

| Variable | Used By | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Frontend + Backend | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Frontend + Backend | Supabase anon/public key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Backend only | Bypasses RLS — keep secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` | Frontend | URL to the Express API (e.g. `https://domain:3001`) |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Backend | Paystack payment callback redirects here |
| `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` | Backend only | Payment processing (optional for dev) |
| `PAYSTACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Backend only | Webhook signature verification |
| `WASENDER_API_KEY` | Frontend + Backend | WaSenderAPI WhatsApp send/receive |
| `WASENDER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Frontend + Backend | HMAC SHA256 verification for incoming webhooks |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | Frontend + Backend | Upstash Redis (used for WhatsApp consent + rate limits) |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Frontend + Backend | Upstash Redis auth token |

### WhatsApp (WaSenderAPI) — Conversational Commerce Bot
The bot is a full e-commerce assistant living inside WhatsApp:
- **Stateful conversations** (Redis, 30 min TTL) — bot remembers what step you're on (browsing, viewing a product, awaiting address, confirming order)
- **Account linking** — phone number → Supabase profile lookup (tries `whatsapp_number` and `phone` columns with multiple format variants)
- **Buyer flows**: search products → numeric pick (1-5) → product detail → ORDER → delivery address → confirm → Paystack payment link generated → order created in DB
- **Order management**: "my orders" lists last 5 with status; "track" shows latest delivery
- **Seller flows**: "my sales" shows listings + recent sales for sellers
- **Smart intent detection** — handles greetings, browse, search, order, track, sell, support, plus universal "cancel/back" to exit any flow
- **Files**: `lib/whatsapp/{state,account,handlers,format,wasender,consent,messages,redis}.ts`

### Admin debug + reset
- `GET /api/admin/whatsapp/debug?phone=2348012345678` — shows consent + state + linked profile
- `POST /api/admin/whatsapp/debug` body `{phone, action}` where action is `reset|opt_in|opt_out|test`
- Auth: `x-admin-key: <INTERNAL_API_KEY>` header OR logged-in admin session
- `GET /api/webhook/whatsapp` — health check (`{ok, hasKey, hasSecret, env}`)

### WhatsApp Anti-ban Architecture
The bot ships with these guardrails to keep the connected number safe:
- **Opt-in flow** (`lib/whatsapp/messages.ts`) — every new contact receives ToS prompt; must reply `YES` before bot responds
- **Opt-out keywords** — `STOP / UNSUBSCRIBE / CANCEL / QUIT / OPT-OUT / END` permanently silences the bot for that number; `START` re-enables
- **Per-recipient rate limit** — ≤ 30 messages / hour / number (Redis counter, 1 h TTL)
- **Global daily cap** — ≤ 1000 bot replies / day across all users
- **Dedup window** — identical reply text within 30 s is dropped
- **Human-like jitter** — 800–2400 ms randomised delay before each send
- **Group/broadcast/channel filter** — webhook ignores `@g.us`, `@broadcast`, `@newsletter` JIDs
- **Webhook signature** — HMAC SHA256 verification when `WASENDER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
- **Public ToS** at `/legal/whatsapp-terms` — referenced from every consent prompt

Files: `lib/whatsapp/{redis,consent,messages,wasender}.ts`, `app/api/webhook/whatsapp/route.ts`, `components/admin/whatsapp-status-card.tsx`, `app/legal/whatsapp-terms/page.tsx`.

Webhook URL (paste in WaSender dashboard): `https://www.vendoorx.ng/api/webhook/whatsapp`. Enable only `messages.upsert` + `session.status` events. In Advanced Settings: `Always Online = OFF`, ignore groups/broadcasts/channels.

## Features Added (Post-Migration)

### Critical Fixes
- **Next.js 16 proxy.ts**: Renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` and updated export to `proxy()` per Next.js 16 deprecation requirement
- **Image position bug**: Fixed `<Link>` wrapper around `<Image fill>` in product card — Link now uses `absolute inset-0` so it's the positioned parent for the Image
- **LCP optimization**: First product card image gets `priority` prop for eager loading

### New Components
| Component | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| SearchAutocomplete | `components/marketplace/search-autocomplete.tsx` | Debounced real-time search dropdown with product previews |
| MakeOfferDialog | `components/product/make-offer-dialog.tsx` | Buyer offer submission dialog |

- **Referral program**: Codes derived from first 8 chars of user UUID; tracked via `?ref=` query param on sign-up URL
- **Promoted listings**: Paystack payment (₦1,500 / 150,000 kobo) for 7-day featured listing; relies on `is_featured` + `boost_expires_at` DB columns
- **Video support**: Upload route accepts MP4/WebM/MOV (max 50 MB); ProductGallery detects video URLs and renders `<video>` player; seller form accepts video files
- **Reviews integration**: ReviewsSection component integrated into product detail page
- **Dark mode**: Comprehensive dark mode classes audited and added to auth pages (login, sign-up), product detail page, and all new components

## Replit Migration Notes

- Dev/start scripts updated to bind on `0.0.0.0:5000` for Replit preview compatibility
- Vercel-specific www redirect removed from `next.config.ts`
- Backend port changed from 5000 → 3001 to avoid conflict with Next.js
- Backend Supabase config falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` env vars if `SUPABASE_*` are not set separately
- Paystack config warns instead of crashing if key is missing (so dev server can start without payment keys)

## Dashboard & Orders v2 Pass (April 2026)

A focused UX improvement pass on the buyer + seller orders surfaces.

### Frontend changes
- **`/seller-orders`** — added full-text search (buyer/product/order ID), sticky search+filter bar with per-filter counts, CSV export of filtered orders, repeat-buyer badge in trust panel, richer empty states with contextual CTAs, skeleton loaders.
- **`/orders`** — sticky search+filter bar, table-skeleton loader, copy-order-ID button on each row.
- **`/dashboard/orders/[id]`** — copy-order-ID button on header, payment breakdown card (item subtotal + platform fee + total), `OrderStatusTracker` now shows timestamps under each completed/active step.
- **`/dashboard`** — mobile horizontal-overflow fix on the 4-stat grid (added `[&>*]:min-w-0` and tighter mobile gap).

### New shared components
| Component | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CopyButton` | `components/ui/copy-button.tsx` | Reusable copy-to-clipboard button with copied-state feedback |
| `OrderListSkeleton` / `OrderRowSkeleton` / `OrderTableRowSkeleton` | `components/orders/order-skeleton.tsx` | Replaces spinners in orders pages with content-shaped placeholders |

### Modified components
- `components/features/order-status-tracker.tsx` — `OrderStatusTracker` now accepts an optional `timestamps` prop (`OrderStatusTimestamps`) and renders the stamp under each step. Backwards compatible — calls without `timestamps` keep prior behaviour.

### Notes for future work (deferred this round)
- Tracking number, delivery-OTP buyer-input UI, and saved addresses require new DB columns/tables and are queued for the next backend pass.
- Full in-app dispute flow, time-series analytics, bulk actions, and refund-request UI are larger features that need their own design passes.
